EXTRACT_PROMPT = """Your task is to extract and classify all relevant symptoms and clinical manifestations
from a patient’s admission note, then summarize them in a single valid JSON object.

Respond clearly and concisely. Avoid speculation, filler, or disclaimers.

### Required Output:

1. A brief reasoning process (internal steps to identify manifestations).
2. A list of present manifestations and a list of absent manifestations.
3. A single JSON object containing all manifestations with reasoning.
4. Stop after printing the JSON object - no extra commentary.

### Reasoning Workflow:

1. Task Familiarization: Review Manifestation Definitions and Annotation Rules.
2. Review Note: Read the admission note and identify all manifestations mentioned.
3. Create Lists: Make two lists — one for present manifestations, one for absent manifestations.
4. Check Completeness: Ensure all manifestations are correctly classified. Revise if needed.
5. Generate JSON: Output one valid JSON object that follows the specified JSON structure / Output Format Example.

### Manifestation Definitions:

* Abdominal Pain Regions
  - Diffuse: Pain affecting the entire abdomen or multiple regions nonspecifically
  - RUQ: Right upper quadrant, typically liver/gallbladder region
  - Epigastric: Upper central abdomen (below sternum)
  - LUQ: Left upper quadrant
  - Flank: Sides of the abdomen between ribs and pelvis
  - Umbilical: Central abdomen around the navel
  - RLQ: Right lower quadrant
  - Hypogastric: Lower central abdomen below the umbilicus
  - LLQ: Left lower quadrant

* Other Symptoms and Signs
  - Fever: Temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F)
  - Rigors and Chills: Involuntary shaking chills or teeth chattering
  - Nausea or Vomiting
  - Nausea: Subjective sensation of queasiness
  - Vomiting: Objective expulsion of stomach contents
  - Jaundice: Yellowing of skin or sclera (scleral icterus)
  - Constipation: No bowel movement for ≥ 3 days or notable difficulty
  - Diarrhea: Loose or frequent stools beyond baseline
  - Weight Loss: Unintentional weight loss ≥ 5% within 6 to 12 months
  - GI Bleeding: Blood in vomit or stool (e.g., melena, hematochezia)
  - Hypotension: SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg
  - Guarding: Involuntary abdominal wall tensing on palpation
  - Rebound Tenderness: Pain upon release of pressure during palpation

* Bowel Sounds
  - Normal: Active sounds present
  - Hypoactive: Decreased frequency
  - Hyperactive: Increased frequency
  - Absent: No sounds after extended auscultation

### Annotation Rules:

* Values:
  - 1: Present — clearly documented at admission.
  - -1: Absent — explicitly denied, ruled out, or resolved prior to admission.
  - 0: Unmentioned — no reliable information in the note.

* Temporal Scope:
  - Annotate only symptoms present at admission.
  - Assign 0 if timing is unclear.
  - Exclude resolved or prior symptoms.

* Objective vs. Subjective Evidence:
  - Record objective signs only if measured/observed.
  - Record subjective symptoms if clearly reported by the patient.

* Negation Rules:
  - Accept indirect negations like:
    * “afebrile” → -1 for Fever
    * “hemodynamically stable” → -1 for Hypotension
    * “no emesis” → -1 for Vomiting
    * “bowel movements normal” → -1 for Constipation and Diarrhea
  - Assign 0 for vague negations.

* Abdominal Pain Region:
  - Annotate a region as 1 only if pain or severe tenderness is explicitly described there.
  - If pain is described in multiple regions, annotate each as present.
  - If region is ambiguously described (e.g., "right abdomen"), annotate all overlapping regions (e.g., RUQ, RLQ).
  - Assign -1 to:
    * A region if explicitly denied (e.g., “no pain in RUQ”)
    * All regions if abdominal pain is denied in general (e.g., “denies abdominal pain”)

* Bowel Sounds:
  - Assign 1 to ”Normal Bowel Sounds” if bowel sounds are explicitly stated as normal OR the physical exam is documented but silent on this.
  - Assign "Unmentioned" if no physical exam is recorded.

* General Guidelines
  - Apply definitions strictly and consistently.
  - When uncertain, assign 0 rather than guessing.

### Admission Note
{admission_note}

### JSON structure
Return your output as one valid JSON object.
Each key is the manifestation name and each value is an object with:
* "value": one of 1, -1, or 0
* "reasoning": 1 to 3 sentences only of how the evidence supports the assigned value; required only if value is 1 or -1, otherwise “None”
